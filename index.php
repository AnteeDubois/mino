                    <p><a name="id380362"><!--anchor--></a>SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having
                    asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from
                    the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the
                    island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I
                    take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when
                    my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the
                    sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.</p>
                    <p><a name="id380370"><!--anchor--></a>I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the
                    inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow—a
                    tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the
                    shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with
                    black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid
                    white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself
                    as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so
                    often afterwards:</p>
                    <p><a name="id380380"><!--anchor--></a>in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and
                    broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of
                    stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,
                    called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,
                    he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still
                    looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.</p>
                    <p><a name="id380387"><!--anchor--></a>"This is a handy cove," says he at length; "and a pleasant sittyated
                    grog-shop. Much company, mate?"</p>
                    <p><a name="id380391"><!--anchor--></a>My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.</p>
                    <p><a name="id380395"><!--anchor--></a>"Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you, matey," he
                    cried to the man who trundled the barrow; "bring up alongside and help
                    up my chest. I'll stay here a bit," he continued. "I'm a plain man; rum
                    and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch
                    ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I
                    see what you're at—there"; and he threw down three or four gold pieces
                    on the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through that," says
                    he, looking as fierce as a commander.</p>
